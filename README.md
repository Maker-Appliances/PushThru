# PushThru
All the files and resources needed to make your very own PushThru Board

**_Note this branch is still under development_**

This repo contains the code and resources for PushThru, a Maker Appliances device.

PushThru is our awesome self build board, connecting to your Pantri Dashboard [(more about Pantri can be found here)] (https://www.pantri.net/). The PushThru board uses standard thru hole components which need assembling and soldering into place.If you dont have time, or just love playing with code, why not take a look at our Pushy board? The Pushy is a complete and assembled board making use of SMD components, all you need to do is add (and if you like, customise) the code!

Check out the guides and find out what we do at [Maker Appliances](https://makerappliances.com)!
