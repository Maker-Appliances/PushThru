# PushThru
All the files and resources needed to make your very own PushThru Board

**_Note this branch is still under development_**

This repo contains the code and resources for PushThru, a Maker Appliances device.

PushThru is our awesome self build board, connecting to your Pantri Dashboard [(more about Pantri can be found here)] (https://www.pantri.net/). 

The PushThru board uses standard thru hole components which need assembling and soldering into place.If you dont have time, or just love playing with code, why not take a look at our Pushy board? The Pushy is a complete and assembled board making use of SMD components, all you need to do is add (and if you like, customise) the code!
